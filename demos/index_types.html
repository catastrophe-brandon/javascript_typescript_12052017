  // === Declaring variables ===

  // old school
  var t = 2;

  // new school
  let y = 2;
  const z = 3;

  // let and const do exactly the same thing with 1 important difference
  // let is mutable. const is immutable.

  // Use immutable programming techniques to speed change detection process.
  // Focused on functional programming techniques.

  // JS was originally inspired by scheme.
  // Need to mutate variables in JS goes away.
  // Code with `var` is legacy.

  // immutable programming with variables vs immutable programming with objects

  // quirks of var
