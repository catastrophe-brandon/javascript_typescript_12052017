  // ==== Scoping Discussion ====
  //
  // Difference between an object and a primitive
  // In memory there are 4 scopes we can work with
  // 1. Global scope
  // 2. Script scope
  // 3. Stack (stack frames)
  // 4. Heap - Dynamically Allocated Memory

  // let is a keyword that allows us to declare mutable variables
  // const allows us to declare immutable variables

  // Variable declared outside a function with var - global scoped
  // Variable declared outside a func with let or const - script scope
  // Variable declared inside a func is scoped to the function

  // Objects are allocated from the heap.
  // variables and properties both hold values, but variables are different from what's on the heap

  // Heap stuff hangs around forever. Variables only hang around for a short period of time.
  // Heap data is never tied to a func invocation or script. It exists "permanently".

  t = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  console.log(typeof t);

  // an array is an object, not a primitive.

  t = function() {

  };
  console.log(typeof t);

  // functions are objects but the log will print 'function'
  // functions are "callable objects"

  // The array allocated above was allocated on the heap.
  // The function created a "function object" on the heap.
  // Both will be garbage collected when they are no longer referenced.

  // Difference between an object literal and JSON
