# Async and Wait

`async` keyword before func parameters

`awaits` before call to the async function

These make the code more terse to strip out some of the `then()` and `catch()`

To catch errors wrap the block of code in a "try ... catch".

`fetch` is really cool. Performs HTTP requests, returns a response.
